=====================================
Creates an invoice from invoice lines
=====================================

The module **account_invoice_line_stand2invoice** is an addon to the module for
invoicing invoice lines.

It adds a wizard to the invoice lines view that allows the creation of an
invoice very fast, from selecting multiple invoice lines and running a wizard.

You can only bill invoice lines of the same party that were not previously
invoiced.
